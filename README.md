# Lexicon Demo

Lexicon Demo is an innovative web application developed for the Colosseum Radar Hackathon that showcases the potential of natural language interactions with the Solana blockchain. Our goal is to simplify blockchain transactions and make them accessible to everyone through conversational AI.

## What We're Building

Lexicon Demo is pushing the boundaries of blockchain interaction by:

1. **SDK Integration**: We're developing an SDK to seamlessly integrate Lexicon into any app, expanding its reach and utility across the Solana ecosystem.

2. **Live Data Integration**: Integrating real-time API data to help users navigate and interact with any Web3 app effortlessly.

3. **Specialized LLM for Solana**: Creating a specialized Language Model focused on Solana-related events and data for more accurate and relevant interactions.

## Current Features

- Natural language processing for Solana transactions
- Voice command input for hands-free operation
- Wallet connection and balance display
- Contact management system
- Transaction history viewer
- Support for SOL and SPL token transfers

## How It Works

1. Connect your Solana Devnet wallet
2. Click the "Try Lexicon" button in the center of the screen
3. Add a contact
4. Type or speak your command (e.g., "Send 1 SOL to Alice")
5. Review and confirm the transaction

## Contributing

We're open to contributions and feedback. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

## Future Development

This demo highlights Lexicon's capabilities, which will soon be available as APIs and SDKs, currently under development in a separate repository.
